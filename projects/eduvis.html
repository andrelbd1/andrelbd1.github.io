                        This project is my Ph.D. research performed between 2016 and 2020, which we 
                        shed light on how to support instructors in analyzing student logs from Virtual
                        Learning Environments. Our main goal in this project is enable Virtual Learning
                        Environments to assist instructors in gaining insights about both students’ behavior
                        and performance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Firstly, we conducted interviews with instructors who work in Brazil and a
                        systematic mapping of the state-of-art about Education Data Mining and Learning
                        Analytics.
                        This study aimed to identify which kinds of information about students the
                        instructors regard as meaningful (e.g., performance, behavior, engagement); how
                        these kinds of information are gathered; and how they drive requirements for
                        improving their analyses.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Then, we analyzed logs from online courses offered in Brazil and compared our
                        findings with results presented in the literature.
                        We explored and analyzed these logs using statistical methods and machine learning
                        techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Furthermore, we have not found in the literature works about instructors’
                        visualization preferences of student logs.
                        Therefore, we conducted a study to identify how much the instructors take into
                        account topics related to both students’ behavior and performance, as well as their
                        visualization preferences.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        We also noted a lack of work showing models to support the development of learning
                        analytics tools.
                        In order to bridge this gap, we presented a model connecting both Visual Analytics
                        theories and models as well as instructors’ requirements, their visualization
                        preferences, literature guidelines and methods for analyzing student logs.

                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        We developed EDUVIS as an open source online tool to assemble dashboards based on
                        our proposed model.
                        This tool was built using Python and Javascript.
                        In particular, all the visualizations (total of 141) were designed using Plotly,
                        which provides interactivity, such as zoom in, zoom out, pan, select, toggle spike
                        lines, and mouse hover.
                    </p>
                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="../assets/img/projects/eduvis/interface.png" alt="" />
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        We captured evidence of their acceptance of our proposal and obtained instructors’
                        feedback about the tool such as their both analysis and visualization preferences.
                        The combination of the answers to the research questions yields a framework to
                        enable Virtual Learning Environments to assist instructors in gaining insights about
                        both students’ behavior and performance.
                        We hope that our proposed model might be a guide to the development of new
                        dashboards and ground future research.
