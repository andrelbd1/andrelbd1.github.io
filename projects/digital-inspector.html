                        Developed under my technical leadership in collaboration with <a class="link" target="_blank" 
                        href='https://petrobras.com.br/en/'>Petrobras</a> during my time as a Data Scientist at <a class="link" 
                        target="_blank" href='https://www.exacta.inf.puc-rio.br/'>ExACTa PUC-Rio</a> in 2020, this project addressed
                        a critical challenge in equipment integrity management within oil and gas refineries.
                        One essential process involves the inspection of equipment, where experts document their assessments in technical
                        reports. These reports, however, can sometimes include inaccuracies or omit crucial information—issues that must
                        be quickly detected and corrected to ensure accurate inspections and compliance with maintenance deadlines.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Our proposal was to build AI-based solution to assist inspectors in drafting more accurate reports.
                        We began by building a comprehensive database of inspection reports from all Petrobras refineries over recent years.
                        These reports typically determine whether equipment is functioning properly and, if not, describe the damage,
                        its cause, the failure mechanism, and the recommended corrective action.
                        Throughout the project, a group of experienced inspectors supported us as consultants, validating our approach and
                        clarifying domain-specific aspects.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        After extracting, cleaning, and standardizing the report data, we discovered that the vocabulary used was relatively limited.
                        This allowed us to classify all possible damage types, causes, mechanisms, and actions.
                        We also identified strong correlations among these variables and between refinery location and certain damage types.
                        For instance, rust being more common in coastal areas.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        We developed a decision tree model to suggest likely mechanisms and corrective actions based on the reported damage and cause.
                        This model was selected for its interpretability and achieved an F1 score above 95%.
                        At Petrobras’ request, we also tested Azure AutoML, which delivered similar results.
                        To simplify maintenance, we adopted the AutoML solution moving forward.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        The final product, called the Digital Inspector, was deployed as a RESTful API integrated into Petrobras' inspection management system.
                        It identifies missing or inconsistent information in real-time and suggests standardized terms for damage, cause, mechanism, and action.
                        The model continuously improves with new, inspector-validated data.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        This project was awarded the Petrobras Inventor Award 2022, recognizing its impact on inspection accuracy and maintenance efficiency across refineries in Brazil.
                        It was a complex and rewarding challenge that I'm proud of, both for the technical achievements and its benefits to the industry.
