                        Developed under my technical leadership in collaboration with <a class="link" target="_blank" 
                        href='https://petrobras.com.br/en/'>Petrobras</a> when I was a data scientist at <a class="link" 
                        target="_blank" href='https://www.exacta.inf.puc-rio.br/'>ExACTa PUC-Rio</a> in 2020. The problem was related to 
                        the integrity of equipment in an oil and gas refinery, which is ensured by a set of standardized management 
                        processes. One of these processes is equipment inspection, where equipment analyses are conducted by 
                        inspection experts and documented in technical reports. Just like any other written text, these reports 
                        can occasionally contain inaccuracies or gaps in critical information related to the management process. 
                        Such inaccuracies in reports must be promptly identified and corrected to ensure an effective inspection 
                        process, accurate information, and compliance with maintenance deadlines.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Our proposal, therefore, was to build an artificial intelligence model to assist inspectors in report 
                        writing. To accomplish this, we started by constructing a database through the collection of reports 
                        produced by all Petrobras refineries throughout the last few years. In essence, these reports consist 
                        of determining whether the equipment is in proper working condition. If not, it was necessary to 
                        describe the damage, its cause, the mechanism of damage, and the maintenance action required. We had 
                        the assistance of a group of selected inspectors as consultants to clarify potential doubts and validate 
                        our proposal. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        After constructing our database, we performed meticulous text extraction, data structuring, cleaning, 
                        and standardization. We made several discoveries after extensive data exploration and the application of 
                        statistical methods. One of these discoveries was that the terms used in the reports were quite limited. 
                        Due to this, we were able to classify all possible damages, causes, mechanisms, and actions present in the 
                        reports. Furthermore, we identified a strong correlation between them. We also found a correlation between 
                        the location of the refinery and the damages and causes, which made perfect sense since rust damage, for 
                        example, was more frequent in refineries located near the sea.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Next, we built a decision tree model that, based on the damage and cause, suggests the mechanism and action 
                        to be taken. This machine learning model was chosen for its interpretability. Based on our tests, the 
                        harmonic mean of accuracy and precision (F1 score) reached a result greater than 95%. At the request of the 
                        Petrobras team, we also conducted a test with Azure's AutoML service, which yielded a positive result very 
                        close to our model's performance. Consequently, we decided to keep the AutoML model to facilitate the 
                        solution's maintenance by the Petrobras team.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Subsequently, we deployed our model as a service called the "Digital Inspector," designed to detect 
                        inaccuracies or gaps in the wording of reports, providing real-time alerts to inspectors and suggesting 
                        the most appropriate terms for damages, causes, mechanisms, and actions in the report. This service was 
                        made available through a RESTful API that allowed integration with the equipment inspection management 
                        system used by Petrobras inspectors. Additionally, the digital inspector can improve its learning as more 
                        reports are added to our database, validated by inspectors, and made available for continuous model 
                        retraining.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        This project received the Petrobras Inventor Award 2022 in recognition of the results achieved and the 
                        impact on the efficiency of equipment maintenance in refineries across Brazil. Undoubtedly, the project 
                        was challenging but provided ample opportunities to learn. I am so proud of the achieved results.
