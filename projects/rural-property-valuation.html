                        <b>(A)ction:</b> We began with a literature review to understand domain-specific methodologies, followed by a deep exploration of public datasets. Due to the absence of a centralized property price database, we developed a web crawler to extract real estate listings and geocoded them to enrich the dataset with geographic features like terrain and altitude. We carried out robust data cleaning, outlier removal, and feature selection to ensure data quality. We also tested correlations between land prices and commodity prices, identifying that their negative correlation limited their predictive value. Multiple machine learning models were experimented with, and a RESTful API was deployed to integrate the solution into internal applications.

                        As Data Science Manager at <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://gaivota.ai/'>Gaivota</a> in 2022
                        and <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://www.seedz.ag/'>Seedz</a> in 2023,
                        I led a project focused on rural property valuation. This process involves determining the price of
                        rural properties such as farms and agricultural land, which serves various purposes including
                        securing credit, property insurance, estate division, and property transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        To begin our project, we initiated by conducting a comprehensive literature review to gain valuable
                        insights into the field. During this phase, we identified pertinent research papers specifically 
                        addressing this issue within the Brazilian context. These papers not only shed light on critical 
                        features and methodologies but also illuminated valuable considerations for tackling this complex 
                        problem.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Subsequent to the literature review, we proceeded with an extensive exploration of publicly 
                        available datasets related to the valuation of bare land. It's important to note that our foremost 
                        challenge at this stage was the absence of a comprehensive property price database. To overcome this 
                        problem, we implemented a web crawler to extract pricing information and property specifications 
                        (e.g., location, area) from real estate listing websites. Furthermore, we conducted geocoding to 
                        obtain latitude and longitude coordinates, thereby enriching our dataset with geographic attributes 
                        such as terrain and altitude. During the data distribution analysis, we identified a significant 
                        data concentration in the Southeast region of Brazil. We implemented a rigorous feature selection 
                        process, enabling us to retain only the most pertinent data while eliminating noise. Additionally, 
                        we conducted data cleaning and outlier removal to ensure the quality of our dataset.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        One key aspect of our analysis involved examining the correlation between the value of bare land 
                        and other features, such as prices of commodities such as soybeans, corn, and cattle. Over the 
                        period of our study, we observed a decrease in commodity prices throughout the year, accompanied 
                        by an increase in rural land prices. This negative correlation was not a suitable variable to serve 
                        as a reliable predictor in our model.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        In our pursuit of predicting rural property values using the chosen features, we conducted a series 
                        of experiments employing diverse machine learning methodologies. As a result, we attained outcomes 
                        that can be characterized as reasonably promising. Nevertheless, an important lesson that emerged 
                        from our endeavors was the necessity to enhance data quality and broaden data coverage nationwide. 
                        These enhancements are essential to elevate the precision of our predictive model.                        
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Furthermore, we deployed a Restful API to provide an interface for internal applications to access 
                        our model. This project was quite challenging due to the limited data we had to work with. My 
                        experience as a researcher was essential in helping us navigate and overcome the obstacles we faced. 
                        I'm incredibly proud of the dedication and hard work our team put into this project.
