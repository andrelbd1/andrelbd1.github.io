                                As Data Science Manager at <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://gaivota.ai/'>Gaivota</a> in 2022
                                and <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://www.seedz.ag/'>Seedz</a> in 2023,
                                I led a project focused on rural property valuation. This process involves determining the price of
                                rural properties such as farms and agricultural land, which serves various purposes including
                                securing credit, property insurance, estate division, and property transactions.

                                To begin our project, we initiated by conducting a comprehensive literature review to gain valuable
                                insights into the field. During this phase, we identified pertinent research papers specifically 
                                addressing this issue within the Brazilian context. These papers not only shed light on critical 
                                features and methodologies but also illuminated valuable considerations for tackling this complex 
                                problem.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-muted-justified">
                                Subsequent to the literature review, we proceeded with an extensive exploration of publicly 
                                available datasets related to the valuation of bare land. It's important to note that our foremost 
                                challenge at this stage was the absence of a comprehensive property price database. To overcome this 
                                problem, we implemented a web crawler to extract pricing information and property specifications 
                                (e.g., location, area) from real estate listing websites. Furthermore, we conducted geocoding to 
                                obtain latitude and longitude coordinates, thereby enriching our dataset with geographic attributes 
                                such as terrain and altitude. During the data distribution analysis, we identified a significant 
                                data concentration in the Southeast region of Brazil. We implemented a rigorous feature selection 
                                process, enabling us to retain only the most pertinent data while eliminating noise. Additionally, 
                                we conducted meticulous data cleaning and outlier removal to ensure the quality of our dataset.

                                One key aspect of our analysis involved examining the correlation between the value of bare land 
                                and other features, such as prices of commodities such as soybeans, corn, and cattle. Over the 
                                period of our study, we observed a decrease in commodity prices throughout the year, accompanied 
                                by an increase in rural land prices. This negative correlation was not a suitable variable to serve 
                                as a reliable predictor in our model.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-muted-justified">
                                In our pursuit of predicting rural property values using the chosen features, we conducted a series 
                                of experiments employing diverse machine learning methodologies. As a result, we attained outcomes 
                                that can be characterized as reasonably promising. Nevertheless, an important lesson that emerged 
                                from our endeavors was the necessity to enhance data quality and broaden data coverage nationwide. 
                                These enhancements are essential to elevate the precision of our predictive model.

                                Furthermore, we deployed a Restful API to provide an interface for internal applications to access 
                                our model. This project was quite challenging due to the limited data we had to work with. My 
                                experience as a researcher was essential in helping us navigate and overcome the obstacles we faced. 
                                I'm incredibly proud of the dedication and hard work our team put into this project.
