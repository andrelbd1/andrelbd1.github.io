                        <b>(S)ituation:</b> In 2021, as the new Data Science Manager at Gaivota, I led a project aimed at forecasting soybean yields in Mato Grosso—one of the most productive soybean regions globally. This project addressed a major agricultural challenge that affects farmers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers.

                        <b>(T)ask:</b> Our goal was to build a predictive model that could estimate soybean yields (kg/hectare) for 89 municipalities in Mato Grosso, despite our team's lack of prior experience in agronomic modeling.

                        <b>(A)ction:</b> We started with a literature review of recent research (2016–2021) to identify best practices and relevant models, selecting two key papers with strong results and open-source implementations. We then built a dataset combining satellite imagery, weather data, soil properties, and official crop production statistics. Based on the literature, we implemented an ensemble model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Random Forests. We experimented with various data combinations and sliding window configurations, and validated our model with MAPE and RMSE. To operationalize the solution, we developed an AWS-based pipeline for data ingestion, cleansing, training, forecasting, and storage. Finally, we exposed the results via a RESTful API for internal applications..

                        As Data Science Manager at <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://gaivota.ai/'>Gaivota</a> in 2021, I led 
                        a important project early in my role. The project aimed to predict soybean yields for cities in Mato Grosso, 
                        a renowned state in Brazil celebrated for its exceptional soybean productivity in the world. This topic is 
                        an extensive problem in agriculture and one of the most interesting for farmers, industry, and government
                        stakeholders for strategies that will lead to increased crop production. That yield is related to the amount
                        of produced grains in a region. To increase this yield, farmers use several techniques, such as: selection
                        of high-quality seeds, adequate soil preparation, application of fertilizers, use of efficient irrigation
                        techniques and control of pests and diseases. Predicting agricultural productivity is a complex task that
                        involves the analysis of several factors, such as climate, soil, technology and agricultural management
                        practices. Predicting agricultural productivity is a multifaceted endeavor, involving the analysis of
                        multiple variables such as climate, soil attributes, technological advancements, and agricultural management
                        practices. Typically, mathematical and statistical models that account for these variables are employed.
                        However, it's vital to recognize that these forecasts are estimates, and producers must remain prepared
                        for unforeseen challenges, such as extreme weather events, diseases, and pest infestations.

                        Given that my team lacked prior experience in this domain, we conducted an extensive literature review of papers 
                        published in the last five years (between 2016 and 2021). Our aim was to gain insights into methodologies for 
                        predicting crop yields, critical information required for accurate predictions, and prevalent models used in 
                        this context. The literature review adhered to a well-defined protocol, evaluating papers for key issues, 
                        objectives, methodologies, case studies, and outcomes. Following a thorough analysis, we identified two papers 
                        that stood out for their meaningful results and their provision of source code on GitHub (<a class="link" 
                        target="_blank" href='https://github.com/JiaxuanYou/crop_yield_prediction'>paper 1</a> and 
                        <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://github.com/gabrieltseng/pycrop-yield-prediction'>
                        paper 2</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Subsequently, we compiled a comprehensive dataset comprising temperature records, satellite imagery, land cover
                        and rainfall data, soil attributes, and municipal-level soybean production data. Our main goal was to forecast
                        soybean yields in kilograms per hectare for 89 cities in Mato Grosso, focusing exclusively on this specific
                        geographical area. Based on the selected papers, we implemented an ensemble model utilizing Deep Learning
                        techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Random Forests (RF). Through meticulous
                        experimentation with various data combinations and sliding window parameters, we achieved great results.
                        To evaluate and quantify the model performance, we relied on established regression metrics such as Mean
                        Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Furthermore, we established an AWS-based pipeline to facilitate continuous data updates. This pipeline
                        encompassed data storage in raw format, data cleansing, model training, soybean yield forecasting for each
                        Mato Grosso city, and storage of these predictions in a relational database. We deployed a Restful API to
                        provide an interface for internal applications to access our data. This project represented a formidable
                        challenge, one that I'm particularly proud of. Its successful execution was a testament to the collaborative
                        efforts of a multidisciplinary team of data scientists. It's worth noting that this project not only contributed
                        to expanding our customer base but also showcased the company's product potential to a broader audience.
