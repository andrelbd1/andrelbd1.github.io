                        As a Data Scientist at <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://ecoa.puc-rio.br/'>ECOA PUC-Rio</a>
                        in 2018, I had the privilege of leading a significant project aimed at enhancing the operational
                        efficiency of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href='http://www.mprj.mp.br'>Public Prosecution 
                        of Rio de Janeiro</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        The objective was to optimize the allocation of prosecutors to legal cases,
                        by ensuring that each case was matched with the most suitable professional.
                        To accomplish this, we embarked on a comprehensive, data-driven initiative grounded in historical legal data.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        This project began by acquiring extensive historical lawsuit data, with a diverse array of metadata such 
                        as case type, cause, and origin. This dataset tracked the legal journey of lawsuits from the <a class="link"
                        target="_blank" href='http://www.tjrj.jus.br'> Court of Law from Rio de Janeiro</a> to the Public Prosecution.
                        One of the most time-consuming critical stages of the project was the data cleansing process, which ensured
                        the accuracy and consistency necessary for meaningful analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Through statistical methods, we uncovered important correlations within the dataset. These correlations were 
                        laid the foundation for building a decision tree model designed to automate the prosecutor allocation process.
                        We selected this model specifically for its interpretability, which allowed us to clearly explain how
                        recommendations were made and to foster trust among stakeholders.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        We operationalized our model by deploying it as a RESTful API service, enabling seamless
                        integration with the Public Prosecution’s internal systems. This allowed users to input key features of
                        new cases and instantly receive recommendations for the most appropriate prosecutor. The outcome was a
                        significantly more efficient allocation process that improved workflow, reduced assignment delays, and
                        supported more consistent decision-making across the organization.
                    </p>

                        This project not only delivered practical results but also demonstrated how data science can be used to solve
                        complex challenges in the legal domain, paving the way for smarter, fairer, and more efficient public services.
