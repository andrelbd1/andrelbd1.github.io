                        As a Data Scientist at <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://ecoa.puc-rio.br/'>ECOA PUC-Rio</a>
                        in 2018, I had the privilege of leading a significant project aimed at enhancing the operational
                        efficiency of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href='http://www.mprj.mp.br'>Public Prosecution 
                        from Rio de Janeiro</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        The objective of this project was to optimize the allocation of prosecutors to individual legal cases,
                        ensuring that each case was assigned to the most suitable prosecutor. To achieve this, we embarked on a
                        comprehensive data-driven initiative.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        This project began by acquiring extensive historical lawsuit data, with a diverse array of metadata such 
                        as case type, cause, and origin. This dataset tracked the legal journey of lawsuits from the <a class="link"
                        target="_blank" href='http://www.tjrj.jus.br'> Court of Law from Rio de Janeiro</a> to the Public Prosecution.
                        To prepare this data for analysis, we meticulously executed a data cleansing process, which proved to be a 
                        labor-intensive yet indispensable phase of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        Through statistical methods, we unearthed critical correlations within the dataset. These correlations were 
                        instrumental in the development of a robust decision tree model to automate the task of matching the most
                        appropriate prosecutor to each lawsuit. This machine learning model was deliberately chosen for its
                        interpretability, allowing us to elucidate its learning process and gain insights into its decision-making
                        mechanisms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted-justified">
                        We operationalized our model by deploying it as a RESTful API service. By doing so, we enabled seamless 
                        integration into the existing workflow of the Public Prosecution, allowing them to input relevant case 
                        features and receive instant recommendations for the most suitable prosecutor. This project not only 
                        streamlined the allocation process but also improved the efficiency of the Public Prosecution from 
                        Rio de Janeiro.
