                    During my time as a Data Scientist at <a class="link" target="_blank" 
                    href='https://ecoa.puc-rio.br/'>ECOA PUC-Rio</a> in 2019, I led a project aimed 
                    at assisting prosecutors in identifying legal texts with similar contextual content. 
                    This project involved in-depth analysis and exploration of data obtained from both the  
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href='http://www.mprj.mp.br'>Public Prosecution</a> and 
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href='http://www.tjrj.jus.br'>Court of Law</a> of Rio de Janeiro.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-justified">
                    The documents, mainly in PDF format, underwent a text extraction process, followed by a 
                    pattern identification and analysis. To construct a vector representation of these documents, 
                    we explored various methodologies and ultimately opted for a <a class="link" target="_blank" 
                    href='http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/embeddings'>pre-trained model using word embeddings</a> specifically 
                    designed for Portuguese text, developed by USP (Universidade de São Paulo).

                    The project began with the extraction of text from thousands of legal documents, primarily in PDF format.
                    Following this, we performed detailed pattern recognition and data analysis to uncover meaningful relationships
                    within the text corpus. To construct a vector representation of these documents, we explored several techniques
                    and ultimately selected a <a class="link" target="_blank" href='http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/embeddings'>pre-trained
                    word embedding model specifically developed for Portuguese by the University of São Paulo (USP)</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-justified">
                    We employed cosine similarity to measure the contextual closeness between documents and ranked the results accordingly.
                    To make this feature more accessible, we deployed the solution as a RESTful API service.
                    This allowed end users to retrieve a ranked list of legal documents based on similarity, significantly simplifying
                    the process of locating relevant legal texts.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-justified">
                    The project was successfully implemented and improved the ability of prosecutors to quickly find and compare documents,
                    enhancing both the accuracy and speed of legal analysis within the Public Prosecution Office of Rio de Janeiro.
