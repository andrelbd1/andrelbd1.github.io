                                As Data Science Manager at <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://gaivota.ai/'>Gaivota</a> in 2021, I led 
                                a important project early in my role. The project aimed to predict soybean yields for cities in Mato Grosso, 
                                a renowned state in Brazil celebrated for its exceptional soybean productivity in the world. This topic is 
                                an extensive problem in agriculture and one of the most interesting for farmers, industry, and government
                                stakeholders for strategies that will lead to increased crop production. That yield is related to the amount
                                of produced grains in a region. To increase this yield, farmers use several techniques, such as: selection
                                of high-quality seeds, adequate soil preparation, application of fertilizers, use of efficient irrigation
                                techniques and control of pests and diseases. Predicting agricultural productivity is a complex task that
                                involves the analysis of several factors, such as climate, soil, technology and agricultural management
                                practices. Predicting agricultural productivity is a multifaceted endeavor, involving the analysis of
                                multiple variables such as climate, soil attributes, technological advancements, and agricultural management
                                practices. Typically, mathematical and statistical models that account for these variables are employed.
                                However, it's vital to recognize that these forecasts are estimates, and producers must remain prepared
                                for unforeseen challenges, such as extreme weather events, diseases, and pest infestations.

                                Given that my team lacked prior experience in this domain, we conducted an extensive literature review of papers 
                                published in the last five years (between 2016 and 2021). Our aim was to gain insights into methodologies for 
                                predicting crop yields, critical information required for accurate predictions, and prevalent models used in 
                                this context. The literature review adhered to a well-defined protocol, evaluating papers for key issues, 
                                objectives, methodologies, case studies, and outcomes. Following a thorough analysis, we identified two papers 
                                that stood out for their meaningful results and their provision of source code on GitHub (<a class="link" 
                                target="_blank" href='https://github.com/JiaxuanYou/crop_yield_prediction'>paper 1</a> and 
                                <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://github.com/gabrieltseng/pycrop-yield-prediction'>
                                paper 2</a>).

                                Subsequently, we compiled a comprehensive dataset comprising temperature records, satellite imagery, land cover
                                and rainfall data, soil attributes, and municipal-level soybean production data. Our main goal was to forecast
                                soybean yields in kilograms per hectare for 89 cities in Mato Grosso, focusing exclusively on this specific
                                geographical area. Based on the selected papers, we implemented an ensemble model utilizing Deep Learning
                                techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Random Forests (RF). Through meticulous
                                experimentation with various data combinations and sliding window parameters, we achieved great results.
                                To evaluate and quantify the model performance, we relied on established regression metrics such as Mean
                                Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

                                Furthermore, we established an AWS-based pipeline to facilitate continuous data updates. This pipeline
                                encompassed data storage in raw format, data cleansing, model training, soybean yield forecasting for each
                                Mato Grosso city, and storage of these predictions in a relational database. We deployed a Restful API to
                                provide an interface for internal applications to access our data. This project represented a formidable
                                challenge, one that I'm particularly proud of. Its successful execution was a testament to the collaborative
                                efforts of a multidisciplinary team of data scientists. It's worth noting that this project not only contributed
                                to expanding our customer base but also showcased the company's product potential to a broader audience.
