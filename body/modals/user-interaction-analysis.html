                                In my role as the Data Science Manager at <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://gaivota.ai/'>Gaivota</a>
                                in 2022 and <a class="link" target="_blank" href='https://www.seedz.ag/'>Seedz</a> in 2023, I led a critical
                                project focused on analyzing user interactions within the company's web system, known as Seedz Mercator. 
                                This project played a central role in enhancing the user experience, determining the efficacy of content and 
                                design elements, ascertaining the most visited pages, identifying engaging components, spotting technical glitches, 
                                gaining insights into individual user preferences and behaviors, and facilitating data-driven decisions to align 
                                with business objectives and regulatory requirements. This initiative was instrumental in helping the company gain 
                                a deeper understanding of their user base, enabling them to continually refine their online presence to meet 
                                evolving user expectations and needs.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-muted-justified">
                                Our initial step in this project involved the integration of a third-party software solution to
                                track each user's actions and manage logs. We established a comprehensive set of tags to map relevant events, 
                                including pageviews, clicks on elements, and interactions with hover buttons. Subsequently, we constructed a 
                                robust data pipeline utilizing AWS services to store raw data, perform preprocessing tasks such as data cleansing, 
                                filtering, and formatting, and then deliver this refined data for visualization. These visualizations served as a
                                foundation for answering critical questions related to user access and pageviews, among others, and were primarily 
                                driven by insights gathered from discussions with product managers and designers.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-muted-justified">
                                In addition to these efforts, I conducted an in-depth study employing <a class="link" target="_blank"
                                href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665963823000933'>process mining</a> techniques to
                                elucidate the flow of events generated by users within the system. This analysis allowed us to pinpoint key flows,
                                bottlenecks, and the average time spent on each flow. As a result, we unearthed unexpected patterns in pageviews
                                that diverged from managerial expectations and identified potential reasons why certain pages were underutilized.
                                Moreover, we successfully clustered users based on their behavioral patterns, a pivotal development that enabled
                                us to craft a targeted action plan grounded in data.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-muted-justified">
                                One notable outcome of this project was the initiation of user interviews, strategically conducted with 
                                representatives from each user cluster. These interviews aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of 
                                their event flows within the system, their goals, and any pain points they encountered. The insights gathered 
                                from these interviews played a vital role in shaping subsequent actions and adjustments to enhance the user 
                                experience within Seedz Mercator.

                                Furthermore, the process we established for tracking and analyzing user interactions served as a 
                                valuable foundation for enabling our product managers and designers to conduct A/B tests effectively. A/B testing 
                                played a pivotal role in refining our web systems, allowing us to assess the impact of design and content changes 
                                on user engagement and satisfaction. I take immense pride in the outcomes we achieved through this project, as 
                                they not only provided us with actionable insights but also drove significant improvements in user experience, 
                                ultimately leading to enhanced user retention and business growth.
