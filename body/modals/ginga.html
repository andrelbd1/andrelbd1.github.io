                                During my time as a researcher at <a class="link" target="_blank"

                                target="_blank" href="https://www.puc-rio.br/">PUC-Rio</a>, I engaged in 
                                a significant project focused on enhancing the Ginga's reference code.
                                GingaÂ® is the middleware of the Japanese-Brazilian Digital TV System (ISDB-TB) and
                                ITU-T Recommendation for IPTV services.
                                Ginga-NCL Presentation Environment is the required logical subsystem of Ginga,
                                responsible for running NCL applications.
                                NCL is an XML application language that provides support for specifying
                                spatio-temporal synchronization among media objects, media content and presentation
                                alternatives, exhibition on multiple devices, and live producing of interactive
                                non-linear programs.

                                In this project, I worked mainly with rebuilding a video player that was used by Ginga. 
                                It was quite a challenge, but I managed to develop a new video player using C++, GStreamer
                                for audio and video decoding, and Cairo for 2D rendering. I also enabled some audio and
                                video properties that were described on NCL, which included balanceLevel, trebleLevel,
                                bassLevel, and freeze. It was great to see the final result, and the figure below shows
                                Ginga playing an application using the new video player.
